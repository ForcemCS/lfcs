# Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) 

These are my personal notes to prepare for the LFCS exam.

This repository includes a detailed guide for each topic in the official checklist of [domains and competencies](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/linux-foundation-certified-sysadmin-lfcs/#exams) the candidates are requested to master in order to pass the exam.

These notes has been collected from a wide range of sources (please, see `references.md`) available on the web and partially re-elaborated by me, plus some additional topics of interest for a developer/sysadmin (still in progress).

Please, note that I took into consideration only Ubuntu (18.04/20.04). Things can be different in CentOs. 

Furthermore, it contains the answers to the practice questions (tasks quite similar to the real ones in the exam) meant to help candidates prepare for the exam.
