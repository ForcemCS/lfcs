# Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) Exam Personal Notes 

These are my personal notes to prepare for the [LFCS](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/linux-foundation-certified-sysadmin-lfcs/#exams) exam.

This repository consists of a detailed guide for each topic in the official [checklist](domains/SUMMARY.md) of domains and competencies the candidates are requested to master in order to pass the exam.

These notes has been collected from a wide range of [sources](domains/references.md) available on the web and partially re-elaborated by me, plus some additional topics of interest for a developer/sysadmin (still in progress): even if you are not interested in the certification at all (but curious about `*nix` systems), you may nevertheless find useful the guides in the first domain (*Essential Commands*) since they cover the very basic commands to work inside a bash shell.

Furthermore, it contains the answers to the practice questions (tasks quite similar to the real ones in the exam) meant to help candidates prepare for the exam.

Please, note that I took into consideration only Ubuntu (18.04/20.04). Things can be different in CentOs.
