## Tips & tricks

1. When entering a password in a terminal, if you realize there's a typo, type `ctrl + u` to undo the password just entered and enter it again.

2. Escaping strings in bash using `!:q` (TODO)

3. reverse search (TODO)

4. Hiding passwords in scripts (TODO)

5. Create a simple chat with `netcat` (TODO)

6. Bash allows you to ignore history entries that begin with a space if you set the `HISTCONTROL` variable to `ignorespace`. Type a space before a command before running it in the bash shell and the command will run normally, but wonâ€™t appear in your history if you have this variable enabled. This allows you to keep your history a bit cleaner, choosing to run commands without them appearing in your history. Bash also allows you to ignore duplicate commands that can clutter your history. To do so, set `HISTCONTROL` to `ignoredups`. To use both the ignorespace and ignoredups feature, set the `HISTCONTROL` variable to `ignoreboth`.

7. Always check if a piece of hardware is compatible with Linux, before buying it. For printers, have a look at this [list](https://haydenjames.io/finding-linux-compatible-printers/) or che the [OpenPrinting](https://www.openprinting.org/printers/) database.
